## Overview
Datecha is a simple yet powerful tool designed to enhance date input experiences in applications. It utilizes a TextFormField in Flutter where users can input dates manually. Datecha is particularly useful in forms where date accuracy is critical.

## Features
Manual Date Entry: Users can enter dates directly into a TextFormField by typing in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2020-10-20).
Automatic Hyphen Insertion: As the date is being typed, Datecha automatically inserts hyphens to separate the year, month, and day, ensuring the format remains consistent and clear.
## How to Use
Integration: Integrate Datecha into your Flutter project by adding it to your form where date input is required.
Input Date: Users can start typing the date in the TextFormField. As they type the year, month, and day, hyphens are automatically inserted to format the input as YYYY-MM-DD.
